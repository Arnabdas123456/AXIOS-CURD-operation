🚀 React Axios CRUD Example
A simple React app demonstrating CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Axios 📡.

📚 What is Axios?
Axios is a promise-based HTTP client for JavaScript that lets you make requests to external resources such as APIs from both the browser and Node.js. It's commonly used in frontend applications like React, Vue, or Angular to communicate with backend servers.

🔍 Key Features of Axios:
✅ Promise-based — Works smoothly with async/await syntax
🌍 Can be used in browser or Node.js
📦 Automatic JSON data transformation
📤 Supports all HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)
🛡️ Built-in support for interceptors to modify requests/responses
⏳ Handles request timeouts, cancellation, and errors gracefully
